# Mini-Digital-image-processing-module-project-Realization-of-a-biometric-identification-system

In this part of the mini-project we have studied and analyzed images from the casia_v1 database
so that we can use them in our image preprocessing phase to keep only the most important parts of the image and finally have the identity of a person based on the degree of similarity between the extracted characteristics and the stored models .
Iris recognition has proven to be a very useful and versatile security measure that will be widely used in the future.
